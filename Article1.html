            <h2>Where Are the EV Utes?</h2>
            <p>Will the BYD Shark PHEV and the Ford Ranger PHEV options convert a generation of hard-core ute drivers to the dark side of electrification?</p>

            <p>First, let's have a look at the two offerings so far. While we do already have an all-EV ute option with the LDV eT60 ute, it does not do itself any favors being 2WD-only, with a maximum 300 km real-world range, and only 130 kW of power output—oh, and the price.</p>

            <p>Disregarding the LDV, that leaves us with the Ford Ranger PHEV, with a claimed 40 km WLTP range (so about 30 km in reality), and the BYD Shark with a claimed 100 km range. As for the real world, we will see, but I’m thinking closer to 80 to 90 km in the real world.</p>

            <p>As for the Ranger—the Prius of compliance hybrid utes—with a maximum of 75 kW electric output and a tiny battery of 11 kWh usable, driving through the gearbox and transfer case system to two axles and differentials via driveshafts, so lots of transmission losses there.</p>

            <p>The motor itself sits between the engine and gearbox, a placeholder where the clutch or torque converter would have once been.</p>

            <p>The BYD system is very similar, if not identical, to the older Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV system, in that it has two electric motors, one for each axle, no gearbox, and the 1.4-liter engine is essentially a generator. Primary drive is from the traction battery that is 30 kWh in size, giving a respectable EV driving range.</p>

            <h3>But Why Are There No Serious EV Utes Yet?</h3>

            <p>The F-150 Lightning is available in Australia as I write this, but it's in the $200K price range—though you do get a decent long-range pure EV for that money—or the LDV option.</p>

            <p>Other than that, what else is there and why not?</p>

            <p>The ute market in Australia is the best-selling and has been for some time, with many falling for the outdoorsy-type marketing that promises the wilderness and adventures that come with it, but most utes never leave the urban environment.</p>

            <p>That being said, it's this very reason I believe that the EV ute segment is slow to develop: they are making far too much profit selling accessories and the usual expensive service items associated with diesel vehicles. Why would they want to kill that cash cow? Every EV ute they sell will mean no more oil filters, no more air filters, no more fuel filters, no more fuel injectors, replacement fuel pumps, DPFs in the exhaust system to be replaced regularly, and when the driver eventually goes off-road and covers everything in dust, grit, and mud. Off-road use means more maintenance, and that means more profit.</p>

            <p>Sure, an EV can tow better, has instant torque, doesn’t require low-range gearing, and is far better off-road with precise motor control for steep descents, but without the constant drip of spares, there is no financial incentive to develop a decent long-range EV for Australia.</p>
